Hi,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the project proposal I sent last week. We have a board meeting on Monday and would really appreciate your feedback before then.

Could you please review the attached proposal and let me know:
1. Is the budget acceptable?
2. Are the timelines realistic?
3. Any concerns or modifications needed?

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
